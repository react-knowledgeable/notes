currently jennie has been doing all the photo editing, which is a lot of work. not sure if we should continue this costly task, but here are some we _should_ actually do
- tell people about what happened during this month's RK
- send out information about talks, links to videos and resources, etc
- tell people (again) to propose to speak at next month's event
