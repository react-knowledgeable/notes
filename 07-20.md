things that facilitate learning / discussions on React

we can use #learnInPublic or we can say that a best way to learn is to teach it to others, and RK can do something to help with that

- this month in React (covers updates), open this for proposal, provide list of resources, 1st talk of each month
- provide some conversation starters for networking break, i.e., encourage people to speak with someone they don't know _on the topic of React_
  + what is something interesting you learned about React recently?
  + do you use X?
  + have you encountered Y?
  + ... im really bad at this, someone better at conversations help me along this idea plz
