Hello everyone. My name is Wei. I'm here to tell you about React Knowledgeable, which is a new meetup in Singapore on the topics of React and React Native.

While this is something new in Singapore, a side note is that me and my co-organizer Ken have been running this internal to our team for a while already.  With all due respect we get increasingly urged to make RK not bound to a company or limit to our team, but make it publicly accessible and make it about React.

We self identify as a fun and friendly podium to share what we learn about React. The most thing we learn by running RK is that sharing is a good way to dive deep into learning if not the best way. 

So here's the plan. There is one type of talk that has been sparkling fun, and those are the lightning talks. Most of my favorite talks here at RK have been lightning talks. And so we will be doing RK in Singapore all on lightning talks. If you have doubts how much information you can include in a lightning talk, definitely check out this one by Andres. The talk was only five and a half minutes. And in 30 seconds the guy had a screen that said "DEMO" so buckle up and enjoy.

Lightning talks are short and if you've ever tried you'd know it's very challenging. We still want this to be as inclusive as possible so we'll give you four options for number of minutes you have to lighten us.. But you'll need to specify that in your talk proposal and we'll run a timer when you deliver the talk. If you finish too early maybe you'll sing through the last minute? And if you run over time Beyonce is going to jump off and sing and welcome you off the stage.

- bugs, you go technical fast and they are great for storytell
- show and tell, for novel ideas, new APIs, hooks for instance
- learning, once again if u'r learning this is great chance to dive deeper or more systematic
- anything about react or anything interesting to you as a react developer, we doing React updates every month, we making this open for proposal as well

first event aug 6
- have speaker lineup on the website
- still have 1 ~ 2 more spots
- if forget about things on the fly, just move on

sequentially first thursday of every month?
- need venue
- hopefully pace the events well with ReactJS Singapore

July 25

A few notes per discussed with @kenlsm regarding the talk

- the uncertainties went drastic when I was trying to justify the virtues of RK, so I removed the numbers and simplified the learning part
- people like the drawing

and a few observations in ReactJS meetup
- this month was 3 lightning talks and only 1 long talk
- but one of the lightning talks was quite long (over 10 mins)
- the lightning talks were show-and-tell of what people built -> the learning and deep diving kind is likely harder to expect
- i feel people are not as sure as I expected to sign up for talks, maybe still observing
