Hello everyone. My name is Wei. I'm here to tell you about React Knowledgeable, which is a new meetup in Singapore on the topics of React and React Native.

While this is something new in Singapore, a side note is that me and my co-organizer Ken have been running this internal to our team for roughly 10 months already.  With all due respect we get increasingly urged to make RK not bound to a company or limit to our team, but make it publicly accessible and make it about React.

To share a bit of numbers here about our internal chapter. We're a weekly series and this week we're at week #37. With our 30 and increasing developers, none of us had public speaking experience to begin with, over the ten months we've delivered more than 50 talks by more than 20 speakers. So that's roughly 2/3 of us and most of our speakers speak multiple times. Today roughly 5 ~ 6 of us have given talks in a local meetup. And some of us will start speaking at regional conferences later this year.

But numbers don't mean anything if there isn't any virtues to it. The most thing we learn by running RK is that sharing is a good way to dive deep into learning if not the best way. This is shared by many of the thought leaders in our industry including dan abramov who suggests that we keep a blog even if just to catalogue our own learning, and swyx who gave a talk on #learnInPublic last month which says roughly the guiding principle of RK. The talk spawned 5 new blogs to my knowledge alone. But that also urged us that we should not keep this to ourselves, and that we should bring RK to a bigger audience given that it has been doing so great inside our team.

So here's the plan. There is one type of talk that has been sparkling fun, and those are the lightning talks. Most of my favorite talks here at RK have been lightning talks. And so we will be doing RK in Singapore all on lightning talks. If you have doubts how much information you can include in a lightning talk, definitely check out this one by Andres. The talk was only five and a half minutes. And in 30 seconds the guy had a screen that said "DEMO" so buckle up and enjoy.

Lightning talks are short and if you've ever tried you'd know it's very challenging. We still want this to be as inclusive as possible so we'll give you four options for number of minutes you have to lighten us.. But you'll need to specify that in your talk proposal and we'll run a timer when you deliver the talk. If you finish too early maybe you'll sing through the last minute? And if you run over time Beyonce is going to jump off and sing and welcome you off the stage.

- bugs, you go technical fast and they are great for storytell
- show and tell, for novel ideas, new APIs, hooks for instance
- learning, once again if u'r learning this is great chance to dive deeper or more systematic
- anything about react or anything interesting to you as a react developer, we doing React updates every month, we making this open for proposal as well

first event aug 6
- have speaker lineup on the website
- still have 1 ~ 2 more spots

sequentially first thursday of every month?
- need venue
- hopefully pace the events well with ReactJS Singapore
