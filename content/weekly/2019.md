## Week of Nov 11, 2019

- We still working on [Airtable RSVP](https://github.com/react-knowledgeable/rk-community-site/pull/79)  
  In a few words, it's slightly harder to code GH auth purely on front end because Github prevents you from implementing the OAuth Web Application Flow on a client-side only application. Need to use some serverless workaround. Will wrap up this branch without GH auth and pick up later.
- Met Ethan from [NodeFlair](https://nodeflair.com/) who is keen on sponsoring local events, will follow up with this next week

- Huijing keeps helping us with our site's layout ðŸ’œ

## Week of Oct 7, 2019

- [RK #3 happened](https://reactknowledgeable.org/meetups/3/)
  - we semi-successfully recorded ourselves, kudos ken!
  - there was a miscommunication going on with our recording with raj (check twitter chat)
- we may all go for engineers.sg volunteer training (follow up on dates)
- we may have DBS as a partner, will follow up in two weeks
- we had a panelist discussion with rk originals, lessons learned
  - sending panelists prep sheets were very efficient
  - chatting is more impromptu in nature, there are good questions from the ground
  - works good on topics

a bit of random thoughts by @wgao19

- we had a very small audience for #3
- also wondering if we have many enough developers who would like to speak
  - good lightning talks are a lot to ask from speakers
  - in general the learning spirits of rk takes more effort
  - we're prolly not great at reaching a lot people, which is fine, we should probably work on growing our core
- thoughts on reworking on our proposal process
  - make it private or create private channel, people may want private correspondence for this scenario
  - wondering if we should send out private invitations to people who we'd like to have
    - we've been doing this on personal level to friends anyway
    - conferences do this
- do we want a group chat?
