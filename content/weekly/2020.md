## Week 2

_Week of Jan 6_

- there was [a discussion on meetup food](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1214272306987589633) conversation initiated by swyx. this thread is quite amusing to read, particularly on the polarized takes on pizzas, [this one looks like our take](https://twitter.com/wgao19/status/1214391587431542786), [also avoiding pizza here (reactathon organizer)](https://twitter.com/Benghamine/status/1214287487389978624), let's see what it turns out to be with our event this month
  - we did high tea, the format was nice, but there were a lot of leftovers (over ordered)
- rk lightning #6 happened this Thursday, Jan 9
  - we gonna play "two people are lying" so we intentionally did not seek for too many speakers
  - [recap](../events/6.md)
- our sign up for Jan event is a bit low
  - we have 19 signups as of Tuesday, Jan 7
  - ? is it because we lose people who know about us from meetup.com, and engineers.sg fetches events from meetup.com also
- met [Dylan](https://twitter.com/zoink) of [Figma](https://figma.com/) and mentioned about potential collaboration
