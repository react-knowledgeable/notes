## Organization

- host: Wei
- live tweeting: Wei
- recording: Ken as engineers.sg volunteer
- venue: 90Seconds

## Signups / turnouts

~20 pax

## Execution

Plan

- 3 talks + RK tpal game
- game
  - sign people up when they enter
  - pick host when event starts
  - prep during break

Actual

- we started event late already (8 ish?)
- a problem in projector setup occurred, could not present laptop when the event started, so we took another ~15mins? to set it up, and with separate screen recording (which requires extra work to combine the videos)
- forgot to mention let nodeflair run intro in the beginning, so we ran it before the break
  - got feedback from participants that it feels like sponsor "buy in" slot with food which is not very nice
- talks went over in duration
- got ~2 groups sign up for the two people are lying game before the event start, got hosts during the break (in general a step behind than planned)
- a lot of leftover food
- ended late

Misc

- we had a participant who came in from DC looking for a meetup to go, he was not sure whether we were happening or not since we closed down our meetup group

In general, wei and ken didn't feel very good about this event. Execution matters a lot and there are many uncertainties than we are comfortable with atm.
