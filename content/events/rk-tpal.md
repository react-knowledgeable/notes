  - each speaker gets a topic that s/he needs to read on
  - three speakers will be pooled together
  - randomly chose one topic of the three speakers'
  - talk about the topic
  - decide on who is telling the truth

## recap jan 3 at rk #59

- did 4 sessions (11 unique people, 1 person played twice)
- it went well when the speaker had some great improvisational moments, then other audience would want to try as well
- speakers who didn't lie wanted to play again

## notable points
- none of the 4 sessions had the correct guess

## what could be improved
- encourage liers to not follow other people's story too closely

## good practices?
- wait for 30~60s after announcing topic to give time for participants to plan their words
- display the chosen topic on the board/screen for audience AND participants to see
- ask "What is X" to each of them before opening to the floor
- before asking for votes, recap of each participants story (allows them to add in additional final details that can sway votes)

the goal is to collectively be more confident in speaking in public
