## [decks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ofHiT0jQORMd1XUdNAmlLDBmM01ETlIORf2tuBrsRqI/edit#slide=id.g47a5664f96_0_56) and rules

- decks were built each with a theme, i.e. react, node, chicken rice, 2019, new year events
- rules
  - each speaker gets a deck s/he can improvise on

## recap dec 27 at rk #58

- did ~6 decks
- it went well when the speaker had some great improvisational moments, then other audience would want to try as well

some decks _may_ be better than others, it may also went well because of the speaker

- deck 2019 went impressively well, the speaker was great at story telling
- 2 browsers walk into a scrollbar went well as the speaker very fluent and confident

## notable points

- normally, when someone did a good job during a talk, it may or may not be improvisational, or u wouldn't know. in this game, all is improvisational, so you know that the speaker had to come up with stuff on the spot, it is very inspiring because you can see the exact tactic the speaker uses
- also exemplifies good storytelling / speaking skills when you put those performances side by side

## what could be improved

- we should probably allow speakers to run the slides on their own, it goes more natural that way
- maybe because we're not familiar with the rules yet, many speakers make it very obvious that they're speaking a deck somebody else built, i.e., they'd say things like "i don't know what this is about..", but that is actually not a key point to the talk and audience all know they haven't built the deck already, so maybe we should add this as an advice when we announce the rules, but maybe people will just naturally get better as we do more of this anyway

## good practices?

this section can be very subjective and specific, not sure whether this is valuable but put this here before we forget

the goal is to collectively learn public speaking skills

- "can someone who knows this better please help me out?"
- even when the slide already has a headline saying something, it is probably still a good idea say it out loud, more like "in this slide im making this point", and then talk about the further points
