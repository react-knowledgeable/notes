## Signups / turnouts

- ~80 signups combined from airtable, jamstack sg, our own deprecating meetup group
- pretty big crowd that looks like ~50 ppl

## Event plan / execution

- 1900 - door opens / put out stickers, find speakers, sort out talk order
- 1925 - event opening / venue intro by thor, jamstack sg intro by thor and ollie
- 1940 - talks 1 - 4 / we have 7 talks for this event, let's plan 70 minutes
- 2015 - break / we break after the fourth talk, the goal of the break is for people to have some time to network or ask questions, we can try to herd people into speaking to each other
- 2030 - talks 5 - 7
- 2055 - closing / tell people where we going for supper

But, actual timeline went much longer because every single talk went overtime. The break was cut short but people apparently got a lot they wanted to talk about.

We also planned no food but it felt a bit uneasy as people start to look for food middle of the event. Let's request light refreshments and drinks for next event.
