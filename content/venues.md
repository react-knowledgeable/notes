Title: Hosting React Knowledgeable #[number] on [date]

Hi [name],

I am wondering if [company] would be able to host React Knowledgeable #[number] on [date]([weekday])?

We are a community with a learning attitude on and around the topics of React. Our event will be all lightning talks with a break for networking / questions in between.

Here are some logistics about our events:

- our most recent events had [estimate number] attendees
- door opens at 7, we start at 7:30, and we wrap up by 9
- more details and agenda will be updated here https://reactknowledgeable.org/meetups/[issue number]/

Some more contact details:

- twitter: @reknowledgeable
- website: https://reactknowledgeable.org/
- meetup: https://www.meetup.com/React-Knowledgeable/
