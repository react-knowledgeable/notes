Other meetups have their own style of hosting. As an example, ReactJS has roughly no hosting. SingaporeCSS has a hosting in a very local vibe. However, we don't have to be the same, can consider as reference.

We've been doing well with all the prep / interviews with speakers etc. We definitely will be very nervous for the first few times and it's ok. I think in the long run we'll relax and have our vibes up.
