### #1

aug 6 2019

we did well

- rly very cozy
- lightning talks are fun and well paced
- nice discussions (i joined a few)
- people like the after snack, it can be regular, better planned out and invite more people to join

we can improve

- for the intro: we can learn to pace things well, introduce people to what we are doing at each segment, give ample time at each segment make sure people are following
- the break is intended for questions / discussions / networking, let's promote it not as a restroom break next times ðŸ˜…
- we can find place for post event snack beforehand and tell people about it

## Discussions

Popup discussions around the organization of RK

### Prep discussion before the first meetup

ken & wei, july 18 2019

Other meetups have their own style of hosting. As an example, ReactJS has roughly no hosting. SingaporeCSS has a hosting in a very local vibe. However, we don't have to be the same, can consider as reference.

We've been doing well with all the prep / interviews with speakers etc. We definitely will be very nervous for the first few times and it's ok. I think in the long run we'll relax and have our vibes up.
