Putting up some initial notes on our costs. Eventually, we'd like to run something similar as [budget spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D3_RS7sMBZZxJRSmrTM_3Rf0ZyTfD3ApbftW8TwZ468/edit) by [WaffleJS](https://wafflejs.com/). For now, will keep it simple.

Below are the monetary<sup>1</sup> costs that have occured:

| item                            | vendor          | cost      | recurrning?        |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------- | :-------- | :----------------- |
| domain (reactknowledgeable.org) | GoDaddy         | SG\$17.26 | Mar 2020           |
| meetup membership fee           | meetup.com      | US\$41.96 | terminated         |
| stickers batch #1               | GoodieSwag Team | SG\$28    | likely half yearly |

<sup>1</sup> Note that the _actual_ cost of running this meetup is much more than the monetary cost, for which RK is sincerely grateful for all our venues, engineers.sg, as well as all the hands we have to make it happen.
