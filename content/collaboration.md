## Collaboration

Organizing a community is a lot of work. But we want people to enjoy the process and not get burnt out. Over time we have come to collaborating on the following basis:

- make best effort to list out all the things that need done
- anybody is free to pick up anything s/he feels like doing

### Creativity

A self organized thing can get routine and that will no longer be fun. So we need some creativity. Actually, we don't "need" creativity. It's probably an attitude.. Basically how it works is we are idea bouncers to each other. i.e., if @wgao19 has any ideas she bounces it off at @kenlsm. Then @kenlsm will ask some questions he has off his mind. And then @wgao19 normally goes ahead gives them some attempts anyway. If it doesn't get carried out in RK, it becomes her personal project. Then she'll either come to a conclusion that it's not worth pursuing (most of the time), or it's carried out with tremendous help and fine work from @kenlsm. The things happening right now are what turns out well as a result.

We're quite automatous (apparently). Creativity means we value things we don't yet know. So we actually don't know what or even how we create things. Feel free to... just create things.

### Sensitive information

Anything that is not written out in this notes, such as tokens, twitter password, feel free to ask anytime in our channel.
