## Collaboration

Organizing a community is a lot of work. But we want people to enjoy the process and not get burnt out. Over time we have come to collaborating on the following basis:

- make best effort to list out all the things that need done
- anybody is free to pick up anything s/he feels like doing

### Creativity

We're quite automatous (apparently). Creativity means we value things we don't yet know. So we actually don't know what or even how we create things. Feel free to... just create things.

### Sensitive information

Anything that is not written out in this notes, such as tokens, twitter password, feel free to ask anytime in our channel.
