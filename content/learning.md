things that facilitate learning / discussions on React

you can call it #learnInPublic or that a best way to learn is to teach it to others, and RK can do something to help with that

- this month in React (covers updates), open this for proposal, provide list of resources, 1st talk of each month
- provide some conversation starters for networking break, i.e., encourage people to speak with someone they don't know _on the topic of React_
  - what is something interesting you learned about React recently?
  - do you use X?
  - have you encountered Y?
  - ... im really bad at this, someone better at conversations help me along this idea plz

After [swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx)'s talk at RK about [#learnInPublic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LearnInPublic), 5 more blogs / notes spawned to my knowledge alone:

- [https://smokinclove.github.io/](https://smokinclove.github.io/)
- [https://github.com/heyjiawei/learnInPublic](https://github.com/heyjiawei/learnInPublic)
- [https://tzyinc.github.io/](https://tzyinc.github.io/)
- james' site, a very beautiful animation, but he refuses to share the link
- my own notes, not in public, because i hope to keep the relaxed feeling that they are for myself
